Our front end development stack includes the following tools:

HTML,
Javascript,
Typescript,
CSS,
SCSS,
REACT JS

We use the following UI libraries:

React-bootstrap.

The front end application currently has some dependecies required for the application to start this are being managed in the package.json file of the application.

### `Getting Started`
You will need a working version of Node (tested with v10.17.0) and NPM to get started. We wonâ€™t cover that here, as it varies from platform to platform.
