              Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”)’s rights during the
              arbitration process may be more limited than the rights you or

              18, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 apply to these Terms.

              manner, you and MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”)
              agree that every claim, controversy, allegation, or dispute
              arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or in
              connection with any work performed for or on behalf of MolecularPro

              including without limitation before you first agreed to these
              Terms, and after termination of this agreement (“Work Dispute”),
              will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by one
              arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association. This
              agreement to arbitrate shall extend to any entity you sue
              concerning a Work Dispute and allege is your employer, jointly or
              otherwise. Such entity is likewise an intended third party
              beneficiary of this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section.
              This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising
              out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in

              Services Limited (“MTSL”) for all of its associated fees and
              costs, including its attorneys fees. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
              THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MOLECULAR TECHNICAL
              SERVICES LIMITED (“MTSL”) ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT
              TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY
              BRING CLAIMS AGAINST MOLECULAR TECHNICAL SERVICES LIMITED (“MTSL”)
              OR ITS CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS
              AGREEMENT ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
              OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE

              COURT TRIAL AGAINST MOLECULAR TECHNICAL SERVICES LIMITED (“MTSL”)
              AND OTHER THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS AGREEMENT. Further,
              unless both you and MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”)
              agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
              person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
              representative or class proceeding. You also agree that the
              arbitrator(s) have no authority to award punitive damages, and
              each party hereby waives any right to seek or recover punitive
              damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration
              (“Punitive Damages Clause”), except where an applicable statute
              allows for punitive damages. If the Punitive Damages Clause of
              this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
              in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or
              unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision in
              this Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration Section or
              invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
              other jurisdiction. MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”)
              shall have the right to prospectively terminate the provisions of
              this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Section. Termination is
              not effective for claims which accrued or occurred prior to the
              date of the termination. Termination is also not effective until
              ten (10) days after reasonable notice is given to the claimant. b.
              Exceptions Nothing in these Terms, including the provisions of
              Section 16(a), will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise
              limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action
              in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through
              the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is
              available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to
              file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property
              infringement claim. c. Arbitrator Any arbitration between you and
              MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”), or you and
              MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”)’s customers, will be
              settled under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act Cap 18, Laws of
              the Federation of Nigeria 2004, as modified by these Terms, and
              the mediation proceedings shall be held in Lagos State and
              Conducted in English Language in accordance with Lagos Multi Door
              Courthouse Rules. ANY SUCH DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN
              INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND SHALL NOT BE CONSOLIDATED IN ANY ARBITRATION
              WITH ANY DISPUTE OF ANY OTHER PARTY. d. Notice; Process A party
              who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice
              of the dispute to the other party by certified NIPOST Mail or,
              only if such other party has not provided a current physical
              address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). MolecularPro Technical
              Services Limited (“MTSL”)’s address for Notice is: MolecularPro
              Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”), Inc., 111 Congress Ave.,
              Suite 900, Austin, TX 78701. The Notice must: (a) describe the
              nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the
              specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good
              faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do
              not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is
              received, you or MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) may
              commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the
              amount of any settlement offer made by you or MolecularPro Technical
              Services Limited (“MTSL”) must not be disclosed to the arbitrator
              until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if
              any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in
              your favor, MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) will pay
              you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the
              arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount
              offered by MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) in
              settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or
              (iii) $1,000. e. Fees If you commence arbitration in accordance
              with these Terms, MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”)
              will follow the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (ACA), Cap 18 fee
              requirements under the applicable ACT rules, as modified by this
              Agreement, where applicable. Any arbitration hearing will take
              place in Lagos, Nigeria, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less,
              you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i)
              solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii)
              through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an
              in-person hearing as established by the ACA Rules in Nigeria. If
              the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or
              the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an
              improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth by Lagos
              Multi Door Courthouse Rules), then the payment of all fees will be
              governed by the ACA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse
              MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) for all monies
              previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to
              pay under the ACA or Lagos Multi Door Courthouse Rules. Regardless
              of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, you and
              MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) agree that the
              arbitrator shall decide all discovery and procedural matters and
              issue a reasoned award, and that the place of arbitration shall be
              Lagos in Nigeria. You further agree that you will reimburse
              MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) and any third party
              beneficiaries of this agreement for any costs or fees associated
              with enforcing this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision.
              Unless you and MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”)
              otherwise mutually agree in writing, you and MolecularPro Technical
              Services Limited (“MTSL”) agree that discovery is limited to no
              more than five interrogatories, five requests for admission, five
              requests for production, and eight hours of depositions per side.
              You and MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) further
              agree that third party subpoenas may be issued only after a
              showing of good cause, upon the arbitrator’s order allowing any
              such third party subpoena to issue. You and MolecularPro Technical
              Services Limited (“MTSL”) also agree that motions for summary
              judgment may only be filed upon a showing of good cause, upon the
              arbitrator’s order allowing such dispositive motions to be filed.
              All information and documents obtained during the arbitration will
              be treated as confidential and used only for purposes of the
              proceeding. You and MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”)
              agree to negotiate in good faith and submit an agreed protective
              order to the arbitrator before making any potentially confidential
              disclosures. In the event that you and MolecularPro Technical
              Services Limited (“MTSL”) cannot agree on a form of protective
              order, you and MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) agree
              to submit separate proposed protective orders and seek an
              extension of discovery and other deadlines, if necessary, to allow
              the arbitrator to enter a protective order before disclosures are
              made. You and MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) shall
              maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and
              the arbitration award, including the arbitration hearing, except
              as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration
              hearing on the merits, or unless otherwise required by law or
              judicial decision. You and MolecularPro Technical Services Limited
              (“MTSL”) agree that the arbitrator will render an interim reasoned
              award (“Interim Award”) on which you and MolecularPro Technical
              Services Limited (“MTSL”) may comment for at least seven days
              concerning the law and reasoning of the Interim Award before an
              appealable, reasoned award (“Appealable Award”) is issued. You and
              MolecularPro Technical Services Limited (“MTSL”) further agree that
              the Appealable Award may be appealed pursuant to the ACA or Lagos
              Multi Door Courthouse Rules (“Appellate Rules”); that the Interim
              and Appealable Awards shall, at a minimum, be reasoned awards
              setting forth the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the
              reasons supporting the arbitrator’s decision; that the Appealable
              Award may be overturned upon de novo review of legal errors and
              for clear errors of fact; and that the Appealable Award shall not
              be considered a final award until after the time for filing the
              notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired.
              Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of
              the Appealable Award, as defined by ACA or Lagos Multi Door
              Courthouse Rules, by filing a Notice of Appeal and notifying the
              other party in writing. Following the appeal process, the decision
              rendered by the ACA or Lagos Multi Door Courthouse appellate
              tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
              The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the
              payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during
              the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14
              days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
